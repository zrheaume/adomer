# adomer Suite
__Zach Rheaume__
_Bootcamp Project 3_

### The concept

The idea from this project came to me after experimenting with the React 16.8 update, and the concept of writing react components, both stateless and stateful, as pure function components instead of class-based ones. Through the use of React hooks ( useState, useEffect, ...), components can be further modularized for re-use. The idea behind adomer is to provide a platform for creating, analyzing, refactoring, and/or sharing 'create-react-app' style applications.

The adomer suite is comprised of three main components:
-adomer online
   +Online application through which users may register with the service, see component tree maps, view analytics, and more
-adomer-toolkit
   +npm package which, when installed globally, allows the user to execute `atk` scripts
-adomer
   +npm package which, when installed as a project dependency, adds "component monitoring" functionality
